  abstract      = {We present a novel large-scale dataset and comprehensive baselines for end-to-end pedestrian detection and person recognition in raw video frames. Our baselines address three issues: the performance of various combinations of detectors and recognizers, mechanisms for pedestrian detection to help improve overall re-identification accuracy and assessing the effectiveness of different detectors for re-identification. We make three distinct contributions. First, a new dataset, PRW, is introduced to evaluate Person Re-identification in the Wild, using videos acquired through six synchronized cameras. It contains 932 identities and 11,816 frames in which pedestrians are annotated with their bounding box positions and identities. Extensive benchmarking results are presented on this dataset. Second, we show that pedestrian detection aids re-identification through two simple yet effective improvements: a discriminatively trained ID-discriminative Embedding (IDE) in the person subspace using convolutional neural network (CNN) features and a Confidence Weighted Similarity (CWS) metric that incorporates detection scores into similarity measurement. Third, we derive insights in evaluating detector performance for the particular scenario of accurate person re-identification.},

  abstract      = {Despite significant recent advances in the field of face recognition, implementing face verification and recognition efficiently at scale presents serious challenges to current approaches. In this paper we present a system, called FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings as feature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128-bytes per face. On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63{\%}. On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12{\%}. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result by 30{\%} on both datasets. We also introduce the concept of harmonic embeddings, and a harmonic triplet loss, which describe different versions of face embeddings (produced by different networks) that are compatible to each other and allow for direct comparison between each other.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep corre-spondence structure learning (DCSL) approach to address the cross-camera person-matching problem in the person re-identification task. The proposed DCSL approach captures the intrinsic structural information on persons by learning a semantics-aware image representation based on convolution-al neural networks, which adaptively learns dis-criminative features for person identification. Fur-thermore, the proposed DCSL approach seeks to adaptively learn a hierarchical data-driven fea-ture matching function which outputs the match-ing correspondence results between the learned semantics-aware image representations for a person pair. Finally, we set up a unified end-to-end deep learning scheme to jointly optimize the processes of semantics-aware image representation learning and cross-person correspondence structure learn-ing, leading to more reliable and robust person re-identification results in complicated scenarios. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach a-gainst the state-of-the-art approaches.},
